# Visoki Sjaj
The project was done as a pre-examination requirement in the first year of study.
This is my first website that I made.
It is a static website intended for a beauty salon.

All HTML CSS code is hand written from start to finish.
The website is not adapted for mobile phones and smaller screen resolutions.

On this project I learned:
 - Basics of Web design.
 - Basics of HTML. 
 - Basics of CSS.
